============

Small utilities for OpenDJ LDAP directory services (http://opendj.forgerock.org)

* schema-convert.py - Converts OpenLDAP .schema file to OpenDJ ldif format
* logstat.py - Compute statistics about LDAP operations from access logs
* opendj_patch4upgrade.sh - Patches an existing OpenDS or early OpenDJ instance to allow smooth upgrade afterwards
* dsmlQueryService.wsdl - DSML WSDL file to use with OpenDJ DSML Gateway

Note: these are my tools and in no way officially supported by ForgeRock.
